  "question": " A 21-year-old man comes to student health services because of a 6-month history of increasingly frequent episodes of moderate chest pain. The first episode occurred while he was sitting in traffic and feeling stressed because he was late for a college class. At that time, he had the sudden onset of moderate chest pain, a rapid heartbeat, sweating, and nausea. He says he felt as though he were going to die. The episode lasted approximately 10 minutes. He had a similar episode 1 month later while on a date; the symptoms were so severe that he abruptly ended the date. During the past 3 weeks, he has experienced two to three episodes weekly. He says he fears having an episode while in public or on a date, so he has decreased his participation in social activities and the amount of time he spends outside of his apartment. He has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. He does not drink alcohol or use other substances. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination discloses no abnormalities. On mental status examination, he has an anxious mood and full range of affect. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
  "options": ["Agoraphobia", "Generalized anxiety disorder", "Illness anxiety disorder (hypochondriasis)", "Social anxiety disorder (social phobia)", "Somatic symptom disorder"],
  "answer": "Agoraphobia",

    "question": "A 68-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-month history of moderate low back pain that extends into both legs. He first noticed the pain while standing in the ticket line at a theater. At that time, the pain was accompanied by tingling in both legs. The symptoms recurred a few days later as he was standing in the grocery checkout line. The pain has not responded to ibuprofen or naproxen but improves with sitting or lying down. Prior to onset of the pain, the patient typically walked for 30 minutes four times weekly. He discontinued his walking regimen 2 months ago because it seemed to trigger his back pain. He has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Medications are hydrochlorothiazide-triamterene, simvastatin, and aspirin. The patient has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years. Pulse is 74/min and blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg. Lungs are clear to auscultation; expiration phase is delayed.
