  "question": " A 21-year-old man comes to student health services because of a 6-month history of increasingly frequent episodes of moderate chest pain. The first episode occurred while he was sitting in traffic and feeling stressed because he was late for a college class. At that time, he had the sudden onset of moderate chest pain, a rapid heartbeat, sweating, and nausea. He says he felt as though he were going to die. The episode lasted approximately 10 minutes. He had a similar episode 1 month later while on a date; the symptoms were so severe that he abruptly ended the date. During the past 3 weeks, he has experienced two to three episodes weekly. He says he fears having an episode while in public or on a date, so he has decreased his participation in social activities and the amount of time he spends outside of his apartment. He has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. He does not drink alcohol or use other substances. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination discloses no abnormalities. On mental status examination, he has an anxious mood and full range of affect. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
  "options": ["Agoraphobia", "Generalized anxiety disorder", "Illness anxiety disorder (hypochondriasis)", "Social anxiety disorder (social phobia)", "Somatic symptom disorder"],
  "answer": "Agoraphobia",
  "explanation": "This patient has agoraphobia, which is characterized by anxiety about being in places or situations from which escape might be difficult or embarrassing. The patient has developed a fear of having panic attacks in public places, which has led to avoidance of social situations. This is consistent with the diagnosis of agoraphobia."

  "question": "A 35-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by a friend 30 minutes after the sudden onset of right-sided weakness and difficulty speaking. The symptoms began while he was lifting weights at the gym. He has not had headache or changes in vision. He has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. He does not smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol. He exercises regularly. His speech is incoherent, but he can understand what others are saying. Vital signs are within normal limits. No bruits are heard over the carotid arteries. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. There is swelling and mild tenderness of the right lower extremity. No cords are palpated. Neurologic examination shows a right facial droop and right upper extremity weakness. An MRI of the brain shows an acute stroke in the left middle cerebral artery territory. Carotid ultrasonography shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?",
  "options": ["Adenosine stress test", "Cardiac catheterization", "Cardiac MRI with gadolinium", "CT angiography", "Echocardiography with bubble study"],
  "answer": "Echocardiography with bubble study",
  "explanation": "This patient likely has a paradoxical embolism due to a patent foramen ovale (PFO). An echocardiography with bubble study is the best next step to detect intracardiac shunting, which could explain his cryptogenic stroke."

  "question": "A 65-year-old man comes to the office because of a 2-year history of progressive shortness of breath on exertion and a 6-month history of nonproductive cough. He now has shortness of breath when walking to his mailbox. He has not had fever, weight loss, or chest pain. He has not had recent sick contacts, has had no occupational exposures, and does not own any pets. He has difficult-to-control atrial fibrillation, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and migraines. Medications are amiodarone, warfarin, lisinopril, tiotropium, and propranolol. Temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 80/min and irregular, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. There is no jugular venous distention. Auscultation of the lungs discloses fine crackles bilaterally, both anteriorly and posteriorly, but no egophony. The remainder of the physical examination discloses no abnormalities. An adverse effect of which of the following medications is the most likely cause of these findings?",
  "options": ["Amiodarone", "Lisinopril", "Propranolol", "Tiotropium", "Warfarin"],
  "answer": "Amiodarone",
  "explanation": "This patient has symptoms and findings consistent with amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity, which can cause progressive dyspnea, cough, and bilateral pulmonary crackles. The drug's long half-life means toxicity can develop even after years of use."

  "question": "An 18-month-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his mother 30 minutes after he fell from his bed onto the floor. Two months ago, he sustained a fracture of the right humerus when he fell while playing in the park. The fracture healed quickly with immobilization and casting. His mother sustained several bone fractures in early childhood, but she currently does not have any medical concerns. On arrival, the boy is crying. Pulse is 162/min, respirations are 48/min, and blood pressure is 122/80 mm Hg. Examination discloses bluish sclera and ecchymoses and tenderness over the right tibia. X-ray of the right lower extremity confirms a fracture of the tibia. The right lower extremity is immobilized with a cast. Limitation of physical activity is recommended to prevent future fractures. Given this patient's condition, it is most appropriate for which of the following types of screening to be done regularly?",
  "options": ["Audiography", "DEXA scan", "Echocardiography", "Retinal examination", "Serum calcium and vitamin D concentrations"],
  "answer": "Audiography",
  "explanation": "This patient has osteogenesis imperfecta, as evidenced by multiple fractures and blue sclera. Regular audiography is recommended because patients with this condition often develop hearing loss due to abnormalities in the bones of the middle ear."

  "question": "A 70-year-old woman is admitted to the hospital because of a 1-hour history of shortness of breath. She has lung cancer and dementia, Alzheimer type, and has had a decline in mental status during the past month. She lives with her boyfriend of 20 years; he has cared for her and has taken care of the home since she was diagnosed with dementia 2 years ago. She has one adult son who lives out of state, but she speaks to him on the phone daily. The patient's neighbor, who is a nurse and a long-term friend, takes her to all medical appointments and ensures she takes her medications appropriately. The patient is unable to understand the poor prognosis of her condition. She has not designated a health care power of attorney. Which of the following is the most appropriate person to make medical decisions for this patient?",
  "options": ["Boyfriend", "Neighbor", "Patient", "Physician", "Son"],
  "answer": "Son",
  "explanation": "In the absence of a designated health care proxy, decision-making authority typically falls to the next of kin. The son, as the patient's only adult child, would be the most appropriate decision-maker in this situation."

  "question": "A 9-year-old girl is brought to the clinic for a routine examination. She has a 4-year history of asthma. Her only medication is inhaled albuterol with a spacer as needed. She uses it only occasionally and has not used it at all during the past 4 weeks. Her father reports that his daughter has an episode of coughing that awakens her at night once weekly. He also says that his daughter has a sedentary lifestyle because 'she coughs if she runs too much.' No one in the family smokes cigarettes, and there are no pets. Gas heaters are used in the home. The patient is at the 25th percentile for height and 90th percentile for weight and BMI. Respirations are 16/min. Lungs are clear to auscultation. There is no clubbing of the digits. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
  "options": ["Add oral theophylline to the regimen", "Add fluticasone by metered-dose inhaler with a spacer to the regimen", "Add salmeterol by metered-dose inhaler with a spacer to the regimen", "Begin a 5-day course of oral prednisone", "No change in management is necessary"],
  "answer": "Add fluticasone by metered-dose inhaler with a spacer to the regimen",
  "explanation": "This patient has persistent asthma (nighttime symptoms >2x/month and activity limitation). The next step in management is to add a daily inhaled corticosteroid (fluticasone) for long-term control of inflammation."

  "question": "An 82-year-old woman comes to the office because of a 1-month history of increasing numbness of her feet. She has no history of serious illness. She has taken over-the-counter calcium carbonate tablets for intermittent abdominal pain during the past 40 years; she takes no other medications. She has drunk two glasses of wine with dinner nightly for 50 years. On examination, gastrocnemius deep tendon reflexes are absent. Babinski sign is absent bilaterally. Light touch to the distal lower extremities and feet produces a tingling sensation. Sensation to vibration over the great toes is severely decreased. There is a mild to moderate decrease in proprioception of the great toes. Which of the following is most likely to prevent progression of these neurologic findings?",
  "options": ["Alcohol cessation", "Calcium carbonate cessation", "Folic acid supplementation", "Niacin supplementation", "Vitamin B1 (thiamine) supplementation", "Vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) supplementation"],
  "answer": "Vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) supplementation",
  "explanation": "This patient has findings consistent with subacute combined degeneration due to vitamin B12 deficiency, likely caused by long-term calcium carbonate use impairing B12 absorption. B12 supplementation can prevent progression of neurological symptoms."

  "question": "A 50-year-old man comes to the office for a health maintenance examination. He says he has felt well and reports no symptoms. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications. He uses up to three cans of chewing tobacco weekly and occasionally sleeps with tobacco in his mouth. He says he would like to quit but cannot seem to do it on his own. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a whitish discoloration that measures approximately 1 cm in diameter on the buccal mucosa. The tongue has a brownish discoloration. Palpation of the neck discloses no lymphadenopathy. In addition to encouraging the patient to quit using chewing tobacco, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
  "options": ["Prescribing oral nystatin suspension", "Surgical biopsy of the oral lesion", "Swabbing of the white area and sending for cytology", "Observation only", "Referral to an oral surgeon for excision of the lesion"],
  "answer": "Surgical biopsy of the oral lesion",
  "explanation": "The whitish lesion is likely leukoplakia, a premalignant condition associated with tobacco use. Given the patient's significant tobacco use and the lesion's characteristics, a biopsy is necessary to rule out dysplasia or carcinoma."

  "question": "A 48-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by ambulance 45 minutes after he collapsed at home. He did not have loss of consciousness. He has a 6-week history of shortness of breath and severe fatigue when he walks 20 to 30 feet. During the past 6 weeks, he also has had a 5-kg (11-lb) weight gain despite a decreased appetite. He has no history of serious illness. He cannot remember his last visit to a physician. His only medication is ibuprofen for intermittent mild headaches. His father died of 'heart problems' at the age of 78 years. The patient has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 22 years. He has consumed 24 cans of beer weekly for 20 years. He works as a painting and drywall contractor but was unable to work last week because of fatigue. Temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F), pulse is 100/min and regular, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 90/55 mm Hg while supine. Pulse oximetry on 4 L/min of oxygen by nasal cannula shows an oxygen saturation of 91%. On examination, crackles are heard halfway up the lung fields bilaterally. An S3 is heard; no murmurs are heard. The liver span is 5 cm. There is moderate pitting edema of the calves and ankle swelling bilaterally. Echocardiography is most likely to show which of the following findings?",
  "options": ["A large pericardial effusion", "Dilated cardiomyopathy", "Left ventricular hypertrophy", "Paradoxical septal motion", "Regional wall motion abnormality"],
  "answer": "Dilated cardiomyopathy",
  "explanation": "This patient presents with symptoms and signs of heart failure. His history of heavy alcohol use (a risk factor for dilated cardiomyopathy) and physical findings (S3, pulmonary crackles, peripheral edema) suggest this diagnosis. Echocardiography would likely show dilated chambers and reduced systolic function."
