  "explanation": "The patient has concerning signs of possible opioid misuse (requesting a dose increase, a friend’s report of diversion). Before taking drastic measures (e.g., discontinuation or police involvement), the most appropriate step is to confirm medication adherence and rule out diversion via a random urine drug test. If the test is negative for oxycodone, it supports the suspicion of diversion rather than medical use."
