Medical history also is remarkable for type 2 diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, and hypertension. His medications are insulin, irbesartan, hydrochlorothiazide, and aspirin. He is widowed, lives alone, and keeps in contact with his two sons. He has a living will, and his younger son is designated health care proxy. The patient is alert and fully oriented. Temperature is 38.4°C (101.1°F), pulse is 90/min and regular, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 156/90 mm Hg. Oxygen saturation is 96% on room air.\n\nThere is a 5 × 6-cm ulcer with black margins over the plantar surface of the right foot; malodorous, white-green exudate; and visible bone in the center of the ulcer. Popliteal fossa pulses are decreased and posterior tibial pulses are absent bilaterally. Antibiotic therapy is begun. The patient is informed that he requires amputation of the right leg below the knee. He declines amputation, saying, 'I don't ever want to go through what I went through before with my left foot.' He is told that the potential risks for not proceeding with amputation are loss of the entire right lower extremity and death. He still refuses the procedure.\nWhich of the following is the most appropriate action for this physician to take?", 
  "options": ["(A) Abide by the patient's wishes", "(B) Consult the hospital bioethics department", "(C) Obtain consent for amputation from both sons", "(D) Obtain consent for amputation from the courts", "(E) Obtain consent for amputation from the younger son", "(F) Review any additional instructions in the patient’s living will"],
  "answer": "(A) Abide by the patient's wishes",
  "explanation": "The patient has decisional capacity and has made an informed choice to refuse the amputation. As a competent adult, he has the right to refuse medical treatment, even if it may lead to serious consequences. The physician must respect his autonomy and decision."

    "question": "A physician would like to evaluate the benefit of a new osteoporosis medication in preventing fractures in women aged 40 to 60 years. A total of 300 women aged 40 to 60 years with osteoporosis documented by DEXA scan are enrolled in the study from general gynecology clinics. The patients are equally randomized into two groups. Group A receives the new osteoporosis medication and Group B receives placebo. The patients are followed for 5 years and bone density is measured annually by DEXA scanning. Results show that the bone density of patients who received the study medication is unchanged and the bone density in patients who received placebo decreased by 2% (P=.01). The physician concludes that the new medication decreases the risk for fracture in women aged 40 to 60 years. Which of the following is the most appropriate conclusion to draw from these data?",
    "options": ["(A) The impact of the medication on bone density may not correlate with the risk for fracture", "(B) The lack of a change in bone density among patients who received the study medication suggests the presence of a confounding variable", "(C) The lack of a change in bone density among the treatment group suggests that the medication regimen is too complicated", "(D) The lack of women younger than 40 years of age makes it difficult to evaluate the long-term benefit of treatment", "(E) Selection bias is likely because the patients were all selected from general gynecology practices"],
    "answer": "(A) The impact of the medication on bone density may not correlate with the risk for fracture",
    "explanation": "While the medication maintained bone density, the study didn't directly measure fracture outcomes. Bone density changes don't always perfectly predict fracture risk reduction."
