    "question": "A 21-year-old sexually active male complains of fever, pain during urination, and inflammation and pain in the right knee. A culture of the joint fluid shows a bacteria that does not ferment maltose and has no polysaccharide capsule. The physician orders antibiotic therapy for the patient. The mechanism of action of the medication given blocks cell wall synthesis, which of the following was given?",
    "options": ["Chloramphenicol", "Gentamicin", "Ciprofloxacin", "Ceftriaxone", "Trimethoprim"],
    "answer": "Ceftriaxone",
    "explanation": "Ceftriaxone is a third-generation cephalosporin that inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis. It is the drug of choice for *Neisseria gonorrhoeae*, which fits this clinical presentation (sexually active male, migratory arthritis, gram-negative diplococci not fermenting maltose)."

    "question": "A 5-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department by her mother because of multiple episodes of nausea and vomiting that last about 2 hours. During this period, she has had 6–8 episodes of bilious vomiting and abdominal pain. The vomiting was preceded by fatigue. The girl feels well between these episodes. She has missed several days of school and has been hospitalized 2 times during the past 6 months for dehydration due to similar episodes of vomiting and nausea. The patient has lived with her mother since her parents divorced 8 months ago. Her immunizations are up-to-date. She is at the 60th percentile for height and 30th percentile for weight. She appears emaciated. Her temperature is 36.8°C (98.8°F), pulse is 99/min, and blood pressure is 82/52 mm Hg. Examination shows dry mucous membranes. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Abdominal examination shows a soft abdomen with mild diffuse tenderness with no guarding or rebound. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities.

    "answer": "Cyclic vomiting syndrome",
    "explanation": "Cyclic vomiting syndrome is characterized by recurrent, stereotypical episodes of severe nausea and vomiting, often triggered by stress. Children are well between episodes. The history of multiple hospitalizations, well periods in between, and family stressors support this diagnosis."

    "question": "A 40-year-old woman presents with difficulty falling asleep, diminished appetite, and tiredness for the past 6 weeks. She says that, despite going to bed early at night, she is unable to fall asleep. She denies feeling anxious or having disturbing thoughts while in bed.

      "question": "A 19-year-old boy presents with confusion and the inability to speak properly. The patient's mother says that, a few hours ago, she noticed a change in the way he talked and that he appeared to be in a daze.

She smokes one pack of cigarettes per day and drinks a glass of wine daily. Physical examination reveals pale complexion and bounding, irregular pulses. Laboratory data: hematocrit 27.1%, MCV 79 fL, reticulocyte count 2.0%. What is the most likely etiology of her anemia?",
      "options": ["Vitamin B12 deficiency", "Folate deficiency", "Iron deficiency", "Infiltrative bone marrow process", "Intravascular hemolysis"],
      "answer": "Iron deficiency",
      "explanation": "The patient's microcytic anemia (MCV 79 fL) with low hematocrit and a modest reticulocyte count suggests iron deficiency anemia, which is the most common cause of microcytic anemia. Her pale complexion and fatigue are consistent with this diagnosis. Iron deficiency anemia is often due to chronic blood loss or inadequate dietary intake."

      "question": "A 59-year-old woman with stage IV lung cancer presents with progressively worsening weakness and a 10.5-kg weight loss over 3 months. Her BMI is 16 kg/m², and she has bilateral temporal wasting. What is the most likely primary mechanism underlying her temporal muscle atrophy?",
      "options": ["Lysosomal degradation of endocytosed proteins", "Cytochrome c-mediated activation of proteases", "Lipase-mediated degradation of triglycerides", "TNF-α-mediated activation of caspases", "Proteasomal degradation of ubiquitinated proteins"],
      "answer": "E",
      "explanation": "Cancer cachexia leads to muscle wasting primarily through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, which degrades ubiquitinated proteins in skeletal muscle. This pathway is upregulated in cancer cachexia, contributing to muscle atrophy."

  "question": "A 56-year-old man with known coronary artery disease presents to the emergency department complaining of chest discomfort and palpitations for 2 hours. On arrival, the vital signs include blood pressure 122/76 mm Hg, heart rate 180/min, respiratory rate 22/min, temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F), and blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) 98% on room air. A 12-lead electrocardiogram demonstrated ST-segment elevation in the anterolateral leads. The troponin level was 0.8 ng/mL (normal 0–0.4 ng/mL). The patient declined primary percutaneous intervention and was treated with antifibrinolytics in the coronary care unit. After 1 hour of treatment, the patient loses consciousness and the blood pressure falls to 60/40 mm Hg. Cardiac monitoring shows the electrocardiogram (ECG) pattern in lead 2 shown below. What is the most likely cause of his condition?",
  "options": ["Premature ventricular contractions", "Monomorphic ventricular tachycardia", "Mitral regurgitation", "Third-degree heart block", "Acute pericarditis"],
  "answer": "Monomorphic ventricular tachycardia",
  "explanation": "The patient's sudden hemodynamic collapse with a very high heart rate suggests ventricular tachycardia (VT), a life-threatening arrhythmia. VT is common post-MI due to ischemic myocardium acting as a re-entry circuit."
