  "question": "A 15-month-old girl is brought to the physician by her mother for grossly bloody diarrhea for 2 days. The girl has had a few episodes of blood-tinged stools over the past 3 weeks. She has not had pain, nausea, or vomiting. She is at the 55th percentile for height and 55th percentile for weight. Examination shows conjunctival pallor. The abdomen is soft and nontender. There is a small amount of dark red blood in the diaper. Her hemoglobin concentration is 9.5 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume is 68 μm3, and platelet count is 300,000/mm3. Further evaluation is most likely to show which of the following findings?",
  "options": ["Cobblestone mucosa on colonoscopy", "Neutrophil infiltrated crypts on colonic biopsy", "Absent ganglionic cells on rectal suction biopsy", "Target sign on abdominal ultrasound", "Ectopic gastric mucosa on Technetium-99m pertechnetate scan"],
  "answer": "Ectopic gastric mucosa on Technetium-99m pertechnetate scan",
  "explanation": "Painless bloody diarrhea and iron-deficiency anemia in a toddler suggest Meckel’s diverticulum, diagnosed via technetium scan detecting ectopic gastric mucosa."

  "question": "A 3855-g (8-lb 8-oz) newborn is examined shortly after birth. She was delivered at 40 weeks' gestation by cesarean delivery because of breech presentation. Pregnancy was otherwise uncomplicated. Physical examination shows asymmetric thigh creases. The left leg is shorter than the right leg and positioned in external rotation. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's findings?",
  "options": ["Avascular necrosis of the femoral head", "Fracture of the femoral neck", "Inflammation of the hip synovium", "Abnormal development of the acetabulum", "Displacement of the femoral epiphysis"],
  "answer": "Abnormal development of the acetabulum",
  "explanation": "Breech presentation and leg asymmetry suggest developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), caused by acetabular underdevelopment."

  "question": "A 27-year-old G1P0 woman at 9 weeks estimated gestational age presents for a prenatal visit. She has no current complaints and takes no medications. She is vegetarian and emigrated from Nepal 7 years ago. She does not use tobacco, alcohol or recreational drugs. The patient\u2019s vital signs include: blood pressure 111/95 mm Hg, temperature 36.7\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse 88/min. Laboratory results are significant for the following:\nHemoglobin 10.2 g/dL\nErythrocyte count 5.5 million/mm3\nMean corpuscular volume 65 \u03bcm3\nMean corpuscular hemoglobin 21 pg/cell\nRed cell distribution width 13.5% (ref: 11.5\u201314.5%)\nSerum ferritin 170 ng/mL\nWhich of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's anemia?",
  "options": ["Vitamin B12 deficiency", "Zinc deficiency", "Gestational anemia", "Iron deficiency anemia", "Thalassemia trait"],
  "answer": "Thalassemia trait",
  "explanation": "The patient's microcytic anemia (MCV 65 fL), normal RDW, elevated RBC count (5.5 million/mm³), and normal ferritin (170 ng/mL) are diagnostic of thalassemia trait. Iron deficiency anemia is unlikely given the normal ferritin and absence of high RDW. Vitamin B12 deficiency causes macrocytic anemia, while zinc deficiency and gestational anemia do not fit this clinical picture. Thalassemia is endemic in Nepal, further supporting the diagnosis."

  "question": "A 31-year-old woman presents to your clinic with a persistent headache. She reports she has suffered from headaches since the age of 27 when she gained 12 kg (26.4 lb) after the birth of her second child. The headache is generalized and throbbing in nature. It worsens in the morning and is aggravated with coughing, laughing, and sneezing. The patient’s blood pressure is 130/85 mm Hg, heart rate is 90/min, respiratory rate is 14/min, and the temperature is 36.6℃ (97.9℉). The patient’s weight is 101 kg (222.7 lb), height is 165 cm (5.4 ft), and BMI is 36.7 kg/m2. Examination reveals papilledema. Head CT scan does not reveal any abnormalities. Lumbar puncture shows an opening pressure of 32 cm H2O. The patient is prescribed a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, acetazolamide, for idiopathic intracranial hypertension. What will be the change in the kinetics of the reaction catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase under the influence of acetazolamide?",
  "options": ["Activation energy (Ea) will increase", "Activation energy (Ea) will decrease", "Free energy (G) of the reaction products will increase", "Free energy (G) of the reactants will increase", "Increase reaction free energy change (∆G) by increasing free energy (G) of reactants and decreasing G of products"],
  "answer": "Activation energy (Ea) will increase",
  "explanation": "Acetazolamide is a competitive inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase. By binding to the enzyme's active site, it prevents the substrate from binding, effectively increasing the activation energy (Ea) required for the reaction to proceed. It does not alter the free energy (G) of the reactants or products but raises the energy barrier for the reaction."

  "question": "A 55-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of a dry cough and severe chest pain beginning that morning. Two months ago, he was diagnosed with inferior wall myocardial infarction and was treated with stent implantation of the right coronary artery. He has a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. His medications include aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, and enalapril. His temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F), pulse is 92/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg. Cardiac examination shows a high-pitched scratching sound best heard while sitting upright and during expiration. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. An ECG shows diffuse ST elevations. Serum studies show a troponin I of 0.2 ng/mL (N < 0.01). Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",
  "options": ["Cardiac tamponade", "Constrictive pericarditis", "Reinfarction", "Early infarct-associated pericarditis", "Dressler syndrome"],
  "answer": "Dressler syndrome",
  "explanation": "Dressler syndrome is a delayed (weeks to months post-MI) autoimmune pericarditis characterized by fever, pleuritic chest pain, and pericardial friction rub. The elevated troponin (though mild) and diffuse ST elevations suggest pericarditis. The timing (2 months post-MI) and absence of hemodynamic instability make Dressler syndrome the most likely diagnosis."

  "question": "A 27-year-old man presents to the physician with concern for pain in both of his knees that he is unable to attribute to any activities that he has recently performed. He had an acute episode of diarrhea 2 weeks ago, prior to the onset of symptoms. He has also been experiencing a burning sensation during urination for the past week. When questioned about any other symptoms, he notes that he has also noticed that his eyes occasionally feel irritated and painful, leading to bouts of blurry vision. On physical examination, the patient is afebrile and has conjunctival injection surrounding the iris. A synovial fluid aspiration of the knee is performed and reveals a white blood cell count of 51,000/µL. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient’s condition?",
  "options": ["Acetaminophen", "Allopurinol", "Colchicine", "Indomethacin", "Leflunomide"],
  "answer": "Indomethacin",
  "explanation": "The patient has reactive arthritis (formerly Reiter's syndrome), characterized by the triad of arthritis, urethritis, and conjunctivitis/uveitis following a diarrheal or sexually transmitted infection (e.g., Chlamydia). The high synovial WBC count indicates inflammatory arthritis. NSAIDs like indomethacin are first-line therapy for symptom relief."

  "question": "A 22-year old active duty soldier presents to your clinic with complaints of intense fatigue, fevers, abdominal pain, and a nonproductive cough. Her symptoms began a few days ago, but she returned from a tour of duty in Malawi and Mozambique four weeks ago. She endorses sleeping outside, using minimal bug spray, and swimming in rivers during her tour. On physical exam, her temperature is 101.5, and she appears exhausted. She has a hive-like rash scattered over her body. Her abdominal exam is notable for hepatosplenomegaly, and her lung exam is notable for scattered crackles. Her CBC with diff is remarkable for marked eosinophilia, and she has an elevated IgE. Of the following organisms, infection with which one is most consistent with her symptoms?",
  "options": ["Plasmodium falciparum", "Schistosoma mansoni", "Plasmodium vivax", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense"],
  "answer": "Schistosoma mansoni",
  "explanation": "The patient's symptoms (fever, hepatosplenomegaly, eosinophilia, and history of freshwater exposure in endemic regions) strongly suggest acute schistosomiasis (Katayama syndrome). Schistosoma mansoni is endemic in Africa (including Malawi/Mozambique) and causes hepatic and pulmonary involvement. The eosinophilia and IgE elevation are classic for helminthic infections."

  "question": "A 72-year-old man comes to the emergency room because of a 4-day history of progressively worsening pain and swelling on the right side of his face. The patient was diagnosed with multiple myeloma 8 months ago and is currently undergoing treatment. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical exam shows erythema and swelling over the right cheek and mandible. An orofacial fistula is present. Which of the following best describes the mechanism of action of the drug that is most likely responsible for this patient's symptoms?",
  "options": ["Inhibition of angiogenesis", "Cross-linking DNA at guanine", "Inhibition of proteosome activity", "Stimulation of PTH receptor", "Binding to hydroxyapatite"],
  "answer": "Binding to hydroxyapatite",
  "explanation": "The patient's symptoms (osteonecrosis of the jaw with fistula formation) are a classic complication of bisphosphonates (e.g., zoledronate), which are used to treat myeloma-associated bone lesions. Bisphosphonates work by binding to hydroxyapatite in bone, inhibiting osteoclast activity. Prolonged use can lead to avascular necrosis of the jaw."

  "question": "A 12-month-old girl is brought to the physician because she is unable to sit and has not learned how to crawl. She keeps her hips and elbows flexed and her parents have to use considerable force to passively extend her joints. She attained neck control at 4 months and could roll from front to back at 5 months of age. She does not engage in play, reach for toys, or maintain eye contact. She babbles and does not mimic sounds. She does not follow simple instructions. She has difficulty swallowing solid foods and often coughs at meal times. Her maternal cousin has Down syndrome. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is at the 25th percentile for length and 10th percentile for weight. Neurological examination shows increased muscle tone in all extremities. The ankle clonus and extensor plantar responses are present bilaterally. The Moro reflex is present. An MRI of the head shows periventricular leukomalacia. Which of the following is the most important risk factor for the development of this condition?",
  "options": ["Maternal smoking during pregnancy", "Premature birth", "Congenital rubella infection", "Congenital CMV infection", "Advanced maternal age"],
  "answer": "Premature birth",
  "explanation": "The clinical picture (spasticity, developmental delay, periventricular leukomalacia on MRI) is consistent with cerebral palsy (spastic diplegic type). Periventricular leukomalacia is the most common cause of cerebral palsy in preterm infants due to ischemia in the watershed zones of the immature brain. Prematurity is the strongest risk factor."

  "question": "A 31-year-old male presents with a 2-day history of watery diarrhea that began 8 days after his arrival from Africa. None of the other members of his family became ill. He reports symptoms of malaise, anorexia, and abdominal cramps followed by watery diarrhea. He denies tenesmus, urgency, and bloody diarrhea. His temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), respiratory rate is 15/min, pulse is 107/min, and blood pressure is 90/68 mm Hg. A physical examination is performed and is within normal limits. Intravenous fluids are started, and a stool sample is sent to the lab, which comes out to be negative for any ova/parasites, blood cells, or pus cells. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
  "options": ["Giardiasis", "C. difficile colitis", "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)", "Traveler’s diarrhea due to Norovirus", "Traveler’s diarrhea due to ETEC"],
  "answer": "Traveler’s diarrhea due to ETEC",
  "explanation": "The patient's symptoms (acute watery diarrhea without blood/pus, onset during travel to Africa) are classic for enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), the most common cause of traveler's diarrhea. ETEC produces heat-labile (LT) and heat-stable (ST) enterotoxins, leading to secretory diarrhea. The absence of blood/pus and fever rules out invasive pathogens."

  "question": "A 46-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with progressive dyspnea and chest pain. She reports that her symptoms started 1 week ago and have gotten progressively worse. The chest pain is left-sided and is exacerbated by coughing or deep breaths. She also endorses a 6-month history of joint pains involving her knees, elbows, and digits. She does not have a significant medical or surgical history. She takes ibuprofen as needed. She works as a pre-school teacher. The patient’s temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 120/78 mmHg, pulse is 89/min, and respirations are 17/min with an oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. On physical examination, a friction rub upon inspiration/expiration and crackles are appreciated at the base of the left lung. She has an erythematous rash that spans the bilateral cheeks and nose. There are also scattered ecchymoses on her arms and legs. A chest radiograph shows a small left-sided pleural effusion. A complete blood count is obtained, as shown below:\n\nHemoglobin: 9 g/dL\nHematocrit: 28%\nLeukocyte count: 1,500/mm^3 with normal differential\nPlatelet count: 80,000/mm^3\n\nA urinalysis shows elevated protein levels. Serologic antibodies are pending. Which of the following is the primary cause of the patient’s lab results?",
  "options": ["Hematologic malignancy", "Immune-mediated destruction", "Mechanical shearing", "Splenic sequestration", "Viral infection"],
  "answer": "Immune-mediated destruction",
  "explanation": "The patient has systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) based on her malar rash, pleuritis, arthritis, cytopenias, and proteinuria. The pancytopenia (anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia) in SLE is caused by immune-mediated destruction of blood cells via autoantibodies (e.g., anti-erythrocyte, anti-neutrophil, anti-platelet antibodies)."

  "question": "A 48-year-old patient is recovering from acute lung injury following a diffuse pulmonary viral infection. The cell type responsible for the regeneration of the patient's alveolar epithelium is also functions in:",
  "options": ["Protease release", "Phagocytosis", "Mucus secretion", "Surfactant secretion", "Recruitment of neutrophils"],
  "answer": "Surfactant secretion",
  "explanation": "Type II pneumocytes are the progenitor cells responsible for regenerating alveolar epithelium after lung injury. Their primary functions include surfactant production (reduces surface tension) and differentiation into Type I pneumocytes (gas exchange). They do not participate in phagocytosis, mucus secretion, or neutrophil recruitment."
